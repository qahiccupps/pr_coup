# GitHub PR Comment Injection

A first-pass Chrome extension for adding a button to GitHub PRs as a convenience for pasting standard text into a comment.

## Installation

* Copy this directory to somewhere local, call it `D`
* Browse to `chrome:://extensions`
* Turn on `Developer mode`
* Click `Load unpacked`
* Browse to `D` and select it

## Usage

Browse to a PR page on GitHub and scroll to the bottom. You should see a `Inject Comment` button.

Click it and the template will replace any text in the open comment text box.

## Notes

* I have tried to condition the extension to only apply to GitHub pull requests only
* You might need to refresh page to see the button. I haven't worked out why some routes to the page need it yet.
